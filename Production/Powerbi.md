# Accessing Power BI

### Overview

Power BI is a business analytics tool that helps visualize and share insights from your data through interactive reports and dashboards, allowing admins to view various fields across multiple sections. You can explore a variety of configurations in Power BI, such as deployments, cloud spend, VMs, deployents failed and much more.

In this section, we will learn how to access Power BI from the CloudLabs tenant.
